## Description
This project is a simple calculator app made with tkinter, a Python module for creating graphical user interfaces. The app has a display entry where the user can enter and see the numbers and results, and buttons for digits from 0 to 9 and basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction and multiplication. The app also has a clear button to reset the display and the output. The app uses global variables to store the output and the function status, and defines functions for each buttonâ€™s functionality. The app runs in a main loop until the user closes it.
## Features

- Easy to use interface
- Supports basic arithmetic operations
- Clears the display and output with one button
## Challenges
- Handling different types of inputs and errors
- Updating the display and output dynamically
- Implementing different function statuses
## Future Plans
- Add more operations such as division, exponentiation, etc.
- Add parentheses and decimal points
- Add keyboard support
